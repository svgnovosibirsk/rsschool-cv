### Briefly About Myself:

From 2008 to 2021, I built a career in the FMCG market from a sales representative to a territorial manager in companies such as Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco, Metro, Baltika, Philip Morris.
During this time, I have developed my *soft skkils, as well as sales, planning and management skills.*

I have been interested in programming since childhood. At school, I attended an elective in computer science.

I seriously thought about becoming a programmer in 2015. I started to study programming on my own from available sources.

In 2021, I got my first current job in IT as Junior iOS Developer.
